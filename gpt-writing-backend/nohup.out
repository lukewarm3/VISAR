node: dp-213-Historical success-0, text: When evaluating the success of college football teams, one crucial aspect to consider is the number of Heisman Trophy winners each team has produced. In this regard, it becomes evident that Notre Dame has consistently outperformed Ohio State throughout history. Notre Dame boasts an impressive number of seven Heisman Trophy winners, including iconic players like Paul Hornung, Tim Brown, and Johnny Lujack. These players not only brought glory to Notre Dame but also left an indelible mark on the sport.

This significant difference in the number of Heisman Trophy winners clearly highlights Notre Dame's consistent ability to produce exceptional talent and underscores their superiority over Ohio State.

The Fighting Irish have a long-standing history of triumphs in these rivalry games, which have contributed to their overall success throughout history. For instance, their storied rivalry against USC, known as the "Battle for the Jeweled Shillelagh," has seen Notre Dame emerge victorious on numerous occasions.

node: dp-213-Historical success-2, text: The number of College Football Hall of Fame inductees from Notre Dame compared to Ohio State is a significant point to consider when evaluating the success of college football teams. Notre Dame boasts a rich history of producing exceptional players who have left a lasting impact on the sport. With a total of 47 inductees, Notre Dame's representation in the Hall of Fame is a testament to the program's longstanding tradition of excellence. This impressive number not only reflects the individual achievements of Notre Dame players but also highlights the overall success of the team. On the other hand, while Ohio State has also produced numerous talented players, their 24 inductees fall short in comparison to Notre Dame. This disparity showcases the consistent ability of Notre Dame to cultivate exceptional talent and maintain a high level of performance throughout history. Thus, when examining the success of college football teams, it becomes evident that Notre Dame has consistently outperformed Ohio State in terms of Hall of Fame recognition.

One discussion point that supports this argument is Batman's willingness to break the rules and employ questionable methods to achieve his goals. Throughout the film, Batman is seen engaging in activities such as spying on citizens and conducting surveillance, which can be seen as a violation of privacy and an abuse of power. While Batman may argue that these actions are necessary for the greater good, it raises ethical concerns as he takes justice into his own hands and operates outside the boundaries of the law.

One significant aspect of his manipulation can be seen through the creation of a symbol of fear that he uses to control the city.

The symbol of the bat strikes terror into the hearts of criminals, giving Batman an upper hand in his fight against crime. However, this manipulation of public perception raises ethical questions about the extent to which Batman is willing to go to achieve his goals. By using fear as a tool, he not only controls the city but also manipulates the minds of its inhabitants, blurring the line between hero and villain. This manipulation of public perception raises concerns about the moral compass of Batman and whether his actions can truly be justified in the pursuit of justice.

node: S-4684, text: When examining Batman's actions in The Dark Knight, it becomes apparent that he does possess certain villainous characteristics, particularly in relation to manipulation and deception. One discussion point that supports this argument is Batman's willingness to break the rules and employ questionable methods to achieve his goals. As evident in the film, Batman justifies his actions by claiming they are necessary for the greater good. However, the direct quote where Batman tells Alfred, "Sometimes the truth isn't good enough, sometimes people deserve more, sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded" (The Dark Knight), reveals his willingness to manipulate and deceive in order to achieve his desired outcomes. This quote demonstrates Batman's deviation from conventional heroism and aligns him with the characteristics typically associated with villains.
